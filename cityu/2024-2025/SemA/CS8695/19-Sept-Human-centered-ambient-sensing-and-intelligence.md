IoT, mobile things

A. Mountaun
What is research? 
 - Research -> Re-search
   - solving a problem
     - known approach for new problem
     - New approach for known problem
   - How this looks alike
     - mountain of Science
   -  North Col-North Ridge Route to Mount Everest, too difficult
   - Methodology(change route)->technonical advancement(less equipment)->optimization(time)
 - 
B. Mobile
  - Literature search
    - google, google scholar
    - wiikipedia
    - https://arxiv.org
    - Databases
  - Gartner hype cycle
  - Mobile computing
    - accelerometer, eg. count human steps, message typed on the keyboard
    - Compass
    - Gyroscope, sense the rotation of the device
    - Microphones (bottom, back, front)
    - Sensors mixture
  - Today
    - sensing(IoT), learning(alphaGo), computing(cloud computing)
  - Human behaviour
    - Understand human arm motions, skeleton tracking, motion inference
    - Eg. elderly care
    - Existing solutions:
      - camera(but limited service area, high system cost, privacy)
      - wearable sensors(but inconvenience, and not user friendly)
    - Can we use just the smart watch on one arm?
      - Elbow-bone(fixed length)-wrist
      - tracking principle, for a given range of a wrist, the elbow range is also limited to certain range
      - Latency
      - Use HMM to reconstrucrture the state and hierarchial
      - Armband
      - EMG sensors

C. Apple
  - Zacks, from final fantasy, dumb apples
  - Keep yourself thinking
  - Story from a movie: somthing the lord made, creation of heart by-pass surgery
  - How to validate your method is feasible? How to create blue babies(blue baby syndrome)to experiment on? Use Semi suturing instead of closed suturing
