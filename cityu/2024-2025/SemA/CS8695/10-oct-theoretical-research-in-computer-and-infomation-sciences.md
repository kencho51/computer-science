Information theory, theoretical stuff, foundamental of communication, shannon provides information theory in 1948

Have you heard these technical terms before?
 - K-L divergence
 - Shannon entropy
 - Optimal transport theory
 - Symplectic geometry
 - Erdos-Renyi model
 - Manifold

Get stuck 99% of the time
Even for the last 1%, you think you are done, but not.

Usually 60 working hours in Academia

Work hard to be smart

Usally 2-3 peers for a topic, not a big group

A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems! by Alfred Renyi

And a nice and eise advisor:
  - do not push students
  - encourage stduents
  - fight with stidents

Some tips:
  - read as many paper as possible
  - break the tasks
  - good habit of doing research
  - organized
  - keep health, exercise ofter
  - seek help from others

Motivation: promising AI application
  - E-commerce
  - Medical and healthcare
  - Social networks
  - Transportation
  - inovative 5G wireless technologies
    - IoT
    - Cloud, fog, and edge computing
    - wireless distributed computing systems
    - cyber-physical

When AI meets 5G: challenges and opportunities
  - communication - computing interactions
    - heavy traffic
    - towards distributed
    - ubiquitous
    - security and privacy
 - single domain knowledge is enough to solve the problems

Overview: interdisciplinary areas

Index coding and pliable index coding
  - classical index coding problems, Yossef 2011
  - Pliable index coding problems, Brahma 2015

Polynomial time algorithm - BinGreedy
  - Theorem 1:

Conventional recommender systems
  - recommend items to users based on their preferences

Conventional contextual learning framework

Theoretical questions in AIGC
 - how characterize the scaling laws, ie., model size, darta size and computing resources?
 - how to theoretically understand the emerging abilities: zero-shot learning, in context learning, chain of thought reasoning?
 - efficient training and approximation: how approximate?
 - how do LLMs reshape the understanding of semantic information and sementic communications?
