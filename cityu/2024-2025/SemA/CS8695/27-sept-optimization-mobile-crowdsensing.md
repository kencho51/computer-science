### Theory and Practice

### Background: mobile crowdsensing
WSN: wireless sense netwrok

Limited spatial coverage, poor scalability, low mobility

### We carry lot of sensors
Eg. iphone, camera, microphone

### MCS
  - good scalability
  - good mobility

  * excessive resources consumption
  * uneven and biased coverages
  * security and privacy issues
  * incentives
  * large variation of sensing quality
