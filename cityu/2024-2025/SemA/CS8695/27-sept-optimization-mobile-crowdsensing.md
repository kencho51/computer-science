### Theory and Practice

### Background: mobile crowdsensing
WSN: wireless sense netwrok

Limited spatial coverage, poor scalability, low mobility

### We carry lot of sensors
Eg. iphone, camera, microphone

### MCS
  - good scalability
  - good mobility

  * excessive resources consumption
  * uneven and biased coverages
  * security and privacy issues
  * incentives
  * large variation of sensing quality


### Distribute tasks selection

### System model: User i


### Game theroy
the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision makers
example: Prsioner's deilema

3 key components:
- players
- action/strategy space for each player (eg. confess, not confess)
- utility function for each player

|      | not confess | confess |
| --- | --- | --- |
| not confess | | |
| confess | | |

A. Best response strategy

B. Dominant strategy
  - Player 1's ds is to confess
  - Player 2's ds is to confess

##### Nash equilibrium

##### Bayesian Game: More advanced formulation
 is a game in which players have incomplete information about the other players


### Task time route as the action
 Task time route of a user is a sequence of of task time point

 player: users
 actions: task time routes
 utility:

### How to analyse a game
 existence of NE
 Uniqueness of NE, one NE vs multiple
 Convergence of NE

### Bayesian potential game
 if there exists an exact potential function
 * r-i: actions of players other than R

### Markov decision process
Computational tools for sequential decision problems by considering both short term and long term consequences of a chosen action

5 key ingredients:
- Decision epoch
- State
- Action
- State transition probability
- Reward


### Conclusion
Time sensitive task selection in MCS using game theory

Delayed sensitive MCS using Markov decision process
