### key drivers
- data
- compute
- algorithms

### deep learning is trial and error

### automated and efficient deep learning

In past time(1901-2005):
  - raw data -> hand crafted features -> features (vector) -> downstream task

Starting from 2012:
  - raw data -> learning features -> features -> visualize

### designing a deep neural network (DNN) involves:

### early DNN architectural development

### exponential growth in DL solutions

### automating DNN design

### Treads in neural architecture search

### Neural architecture search (NAS)
 - research objective
 - application, optimization. formulation

### limited hardware resources in real world

### formulate NAS as a multi-objective problem
  - search space: Marcro, Micro, Template-based
  - search algorithm
  - performance evaluation

### Research issue 1: 
  - Solve NAS as a multi-objective problem
    - scalariztion: turn 2 objectives to a single objective
   
### Evaluating a DNN architecture is expensige
  - ImageNet
  - Supernet, inherit weights

### Accelerating DNN architecture evaluation
  - how informative this predictor can be
  - how many training models will be needed

### pair-wise ranking based surrogate modelling

### Improv e sample efficiency
  - problem: 2-D Rosnbrock 
  - existing approaches: one-shot aprocach
  - interactive modelling (use search to guide where to sample)

### NSGANetV2 pipeline

### ExoXbench: under the hood

### Extending to more objectives
- refrence direction

### Extending beyound standard datasets

### Next Rea

### State of Affairs
  - social/demographic biase
  - privacy leakage

### Robustness-aware DNN defsign

  - 


### Big picture
  - Deep learning + application

### Automated
