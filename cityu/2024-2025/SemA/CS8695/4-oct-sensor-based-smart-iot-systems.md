# What is IoT?
There is no such definition, because it has some many definition


Now, only 1% of things are connected - refrigerator, car, washing maching, AirCon ...

Every electonic devices belong to IoT

World of Wearable Applications

Technical details of IoT
  - Perception layer: sensors and activators
  - Network layer: routers and gateways
  - Application layer: cloud/servers

Sensorless sensing
  - Using wifi: wireless router, wireless signal reflection

Communication technologies in IoT
  - BlueTooth, 2.4GHz
  - Zigbee, 2.4GHz
  - Z-Wave, 900Hz
  - 6LowPAN(IPv6 over low power wireless peronal area network)
  - Thread, 2.4GHz, supports a mesh network of up to 250 nodes
  - WiFi, 2.4GHz or 5GHz, 50m-100m range
  - Cellular, 5G(massive MIMO/mmWave), 900/1800/1900/2100MHz, range: 35km max for GSM, 200km max for CDMA
  - NFC( near field communication), 13.56MHz(ISM), range: 10cm
  - LoRa, range: 2-5km (urban), 15km(suburban)

Application layer protocols
  - MQTT protocol
  - CoAP protocal

Research:
  - help devices to authenticate other device
  - Accerlerometer uses a lot of energy, proposed KEH gait recognition, gait means identify how people walks
  - Gait based auhentication on smartphone
  - LoRa based smart building solution: EMIoT: emergency lighting internet of things
